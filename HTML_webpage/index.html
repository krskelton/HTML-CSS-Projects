            <p>This is a sample paragraph<br>that I wanted to demonstrate a line break.</p>
            <p>I can also demonstrate how to style just one <span class="styled">word</span> with a span element.</p>
            <p>I work for the Dumb&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;League and I used a non-breaking space because I want the name to always appear on the same line.</p>
